                  <p>PANCAKE is THE original ping pong social club. Our flagship is located in New York City, where our story began almost ten years ago.

                    (Ask us about Naked Ping Pong. Don’t worry, it’s not weird.)
                    
                    We now have eight (and counting) venues throughout the US and Canada. All of our venues center around ping pong and offer a minimum of twelve courts, in addition to a full-service restaurant and craft cocktail bar.
                    
                    Plus, we have the coolest and friendliest staff in the biz.</p>

                            <p>Absolutely not! We do offer an awesome monthly membership with tons of benefits for all of our devoted ping pongers to connect with other like minded individuals, but membership is never required for entry. We also have weekly tournaments and a seasonal Social League for those who want just a little bit of commitment. If none of those options are for you, just come by during our regular business hours and hop on a table. No strings attached. (See venue page for pricing and advanced reservations.) For more info on our memberships and tournaments, give us a call at 212-982-8802.</p>
